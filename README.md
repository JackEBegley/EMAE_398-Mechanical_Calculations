# EMAE_398-Mechanical_Calculations
Mechanical calculations for a three-dimensional slider crank mechanism. This was used to determine mechanism parameters (crank arm length, connecting shaft length, and axis displacement) and calculate the corresponding stroke length and stroke rate.
This is part of a mechanical engineering senior design project at Case Western Reserve University.
